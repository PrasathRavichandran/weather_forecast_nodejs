This project was developed on the top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), integrating with [Weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API. Node.js is very popular among developers nowadays. By including [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) module to the node.js, gives featureful web applications and APIs. 

The utilization of [handlebars js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) provides semantic templates, fast execution, and give features to including JavaScript into templates. This project is merely my attempt to put something together based on the ideas put accross in Node.js course videos and documentation.

## Live Demo
This project is deployed in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Please visit (https://nodejs-weatherforecast-app.herokuapp.com/) or click [LIVE DEMO](https://nodejs-weatherforecast-app.herokuapp.com/) to preview the application.
## Concepts
In this project I have used [Node.js(10.16.1)](https://nodejs.org/), [Express.js(4.17.1)](https://expressjs.com/), [Handlebars.js(4.1.1)](https://handlebarsjs.com/). I also integrated [Mapbox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/) for getting the latitude, longitude of the searched location and [Weatherstack API](https://weatherstack.com/documentation) for getting weather reports.
## Platforms
This application is built under [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). Then [postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing API request & response and I used [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE.
## Development Server
Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder. Run `npm i` to install all the available package from the node package manager for the project and run `npm run dev` in the terminal. The server is started listing to the port 3000, then navigate to the browser and type the url `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
